# MasterControl Fork info
We forked PDF.js so that we could apply a few customizations to their viewer. We're working from a branch called mc-master. We've also added some gulp tasks to build and deploy to our artifactory instance. Follow the instructions from the original README below to install dependencies after you've checked out our branch.

## Maintaining our fork
The `master` branch in our fork should be identical to `master` on the upstream mozilla repo. Because of this it should always be safe to sync `master` with the upstream and push that to our repo without doing any special testing.

### Synchronizing with upstream mozilla:pdf.js
Since master is an untouched copy of Mozilla's master we can synchronize our fork as often as we'd like with no impacts to our MC functionality.

You can either use the "Sync Fork" button in the github UI 

OR 

Perform the sync manually as described below:

- add upstream remote to your working copy
    ```
    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ git fetch upstream
    ```
- merge `upstream/master` into our fork's master (`master` not `mc-master`)
    ```
    $ git switch master
    $ git merge upstream/master
    ```
- push `master` up to our fork's repo (include the new tags)
    ```
    $ git push --tags origin master
    ```

### Updating `mc-master` with changes from the upstream master
This should be done after syncing master as described above. The idea here is to separate this type of sync from your story/defect work for better history tracking. 

- Pick a release that you want to merge. Note: choose a released tag rather than master, since there could be unreleased/untested functionality in the master branch.
- Merge the tagged commit into our `mc-master`. The first command creates a new branch based on mc-master and switches you to it.
    ```
    $ git switch -c merge-v3.1.81-into-mc-master mc-master
    $ git merge v3.1.81
    ```
- You're likely to have merge conflicts to resolve, good luck. Consider the suggestions below. 
  - It can be helpful to compare our mc-master with the most recent tag it was based off of in order to see _only_ what MC has changed. Github's compare tool is could be handy but beware of how git histories are treated: https://github.com/MasterControlIncPublic/pdf.js/compare/v4.3.136...MasterControlIncPublic:pdf.js:mc-master
  - An alternative would be to use a simple git-diff command `git diff v4.3.136 mc-master`
- Make sure things still work and MC's customizations are still in place, deploy snapshot, test, etc
- Create a merge commit PR for `merge-v3.1.81-into-mc-master` that will go in before your story branch PR goes in.
  - **Make sure to use a merge commit PR (NOT a squash)** so that we retain Mozilla's commit history and future merges of this type are possible. In your PR title include which version from Mozilla has been merged in. **Note: when creating a PR make sure to select our repository and _not_ Mozilla's.**

### Feature Work
New feature work can be done as normal on a feature branch based off `mc-master`.

Use a **squash merge PR for new feature work** so that all your development commits don't bloat the history of `mc-master`.

### Changes We Have Made From Mainline

* These README updates
* The additional gulp tasks that detailed below
* We don't allow download (web/app.js)
* We don't allow save (web/app.js)
* We don't allow annotating/inking the pdf (web/viewer.html) (currently just hiding the button, we may want to find a more pdf.js way to disable editing)
* We change the print resolution (web/app_options.js)
* Configurably can allow printing (web/pdf_print_service.js)
* Affect styling via css (web/pdf_thumbnail_view.js, web/viewer.css, web/viewer.html)
* Removed dark theme (web/viewer.css)
* Added presentation mode to the toolbar (web/toolbar.js)
* Include Global-complete styles (web/viewer.html)
* Turned off rendering of form field values via HTML canvas due to issues with it rendering correctly with hardware acceleration on in Chromium browsers (the default) (core/annotation.js)
* Changed AnnotationMode to "ENABLE" which disables interactive form fields. This setting may be dependent on the form field rendering change above. (web/app_options.js)


### Building during development
To build for use in MasterControl during developmental testing you can either run

    $ gulp generic

Which will quickly build PDF.js for development purposes (not minified, packaged, etc)

OR

    $ gulp mc-build

This will build PDF.js in a minified form and zip it up in a file named `mcPDFjs-<version>.zip`. This is the artifact that we deploy to artifactory.

You can copy the result (or unzip the mc artifact) into `<site>/services/StaticContent/js/PDFjs/` so that folder contains the `build` and `web` folders.

### Testing

The PRs will run automated testing. You can do that locally with commands like `gulp ci-test` (and possibly autofix some linting with the `--fix` argument)

### Deploying an artifact to Artifactory
Please make sure you don't have any uncommitted changes as they'd be zipped and deployed in the artifact too. Create the following environment variables with your artifactory credentials. The password could use your artifactory API key.  `artifactory_username` and `artifactory_password`. The following commands will first call `mc-build`.

#### Deploying a snapshot
You should be able to deploy a snapshot to artifactory by running the following command.

    $ gulp mc-deploy-snapshot

#### Deploying a release
**Only release builds from mc-master!** This will deploy straight to our libs-release-local repo, **you have been warned**.

First make sure the version is correct in pdfjs.config. Then run:

    $ gulp mc-deploy-release

Please don't forget to tag the commit you deployed and push the tags to the repository with commands similar to the following:

    $ git tag -a v3.1.37-mc -m "Release v3.1.37-mc"
    $ git push --tags origin mc-master
    
We're using the tagname pattern of `v[versionNumber]-mc` like `v3.1.37-mc` to help differentiate our tags since we're building from a different branch and the commit counting (used in the automatic version number creation) will be different and likely _behind_ the Mozilla PDFjs numbers.

TODO: Consider changing our tagging practice to show both which mozilla tag we're based off of and which version the mc-build process built. Perhaps something like v4.3.136-moz_v4.3.238-mc or v4.3.136-mc238

# ORIGINAL README BELOW
# PDF.js [![CI](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?query=branch%3Amaster)](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

## Getting Started

### Online demo

Please note that the "Modern browsers" version assumes native support for the
latest JavaScript features; please also see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support).

+ Modern browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

+ Older browsers: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/legacy/web/viewer.html

### Browser Extensions

#### Firefox

PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.

#### Chrome

+ The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm).
*This extension is maintained by [@Rob--W](https://github.com/Rob--W).*
+ Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue `npx gulp chromium`. Then open
Chrome, go to `Tools > Extension` and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory `build/chromium`.

## Getting the Code

To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
    $ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the [official package](https://nodejs.org) or via
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). If everything worked out, install
all dependencies for PDF.js:

    $ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a `file://` URL. Run:

    $ npx gulp server

and then you can open:

+ http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this assumes the latest version of Mozilla Firefox; refer to [Building PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/README.md#building-pdfjs) for non-development usage of the PDF.js library.

It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

+ http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

## Building PDF.js

In order to bundle all `src/` files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:

    $ npx gulp generic

If you need to support older browsers, run:

    $ npx gulp generic-legacy

This will generate `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js` in the `build/generic/build/` directory (respectively `build/generic-legacy/build/`).
Both scripts are needed but only `pdf.js` needs to be included since `pdf.worker.js` will
be loaded by `pdf.js`. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.

## Using PDF.js in a web application

To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM under
the `pdfjs-dist` name. For more information and examples please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website) on this subject.

## Including via a CDN

PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:
 - https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
 - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
 - https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

## Learning

You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

+ [Interactive examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples)

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/). Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via `npx gulp dist-install` command.
